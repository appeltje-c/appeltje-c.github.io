# Jump in

To manage the dependencies and build process of your app you can either use yarn
or npm. There used to be a significant difference in performance and security
using yarn but npm has closed the gaps pretty much. Catch-up [here](https://www.sitepoint.com/yarn-vs-npm/).

Create yourself a folder to work in and follow the steps.

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="yarn" label="Yarn" default>
    ```bash
      yarn create react-app starter-app --template typescript
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="npm" label="npm">
    ```bash
      npm init react-app starter-app --template typescript
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

This will create a new React app in the folder starter-app. Easy as that.

Change into the starter-app folder that was just created to start the
development server.

```bash
cd starter-app 
yarn start
```

And visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser and behold
your React App! üöÄ

import ReactApp from '../../static/img/02-starting-your-app/react-app.png';

<img
 src={ReactApp}
 alt="project structure"
 width="400"/>

This was very short, it is going to get better, promised! Keep reading.

## Typescript

Notice the ```--template typescript``` in the command. By using this option we
requested the React app to be written in [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).

While you can create your app in 'plain' Javascript it is a significant help to
use Typescript as it provides some extra's that Javascript does not provide.

As a superset of Javascript, Typescript offers static typing, classes and
interfaces which help to strong(er) type your data structures and methods.
The compiler and your IDE will be able to warn you about inconsistencies in your
code ahead of time like passing a numeric parameter to a method when it
expects a string.

Typing not only helps avoiding incorrect code usage, it asks you to
think better about your data structures and the code that uses it. You have to be
more explicit how you design your code resulting in cleaner code.
This in turn improves readability, testability and maintainability. It makes tasks
like refactoring a lot less difficult to do.

Lastly, be aware that the only place where Typescript lives is as annotations and
definitions in your code and is compiled into plain Javascript at build time.
In other words your App will not 'run' any typescript as it is all stripped and
compiled into plain old Javascript. There are no performance differences between
a running App written in Javascript or Typescript.

## Folder structure

Lets examine what was created for us. Open the project folder "starter-app" in
your IDE. I use VSCode.

import ProjectStructure from '../../static/img/02-starting-your-app/project-structure.png';

<img
 src={ProjectStructure}
 alt="project structure"
 width="700"/>

<br/><br/>

> **node_modules**

First folder from the top contains the libraries a.k.a dependencies your App uses.
Based on the dependencies defined in the ```package.json``` your package manager
(yarn or npm) downloads those packages so your project can make use of them.
Those dependencies include anything needed to make your development process work.

> **public**

When we take a look inside the public folder we find some static assets that are
used to deployed your app. The index.html is the file that will invoke the
Javascript that makes up your app. You can add more assets here yourself although
it is strongly advised to import assets in your code instead.
[Read why](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/using-the-public-folder/)  

> **src**

The src, short for source, folder is where the magic happens. The code you will
be writing yourself is stored here. The features you are going to add to your
app will live here.

As a start you have been given some files:

* .css - [Cascading Style Sheet](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/First_steps/What_is_CSS)
* .ts - Typescript
* .tsx - Typescript versions of [.jsx](https://react.dev/learn/writing-markup-with-jsx)
  files. We will be talking a lot about .jsx files so don't worry if you not grasp
  it all immediately, we will get there!
* .svg - A [Scalable Vector Graphic](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG),
  the logo of React in this case

You are going to work mostly with these type of files to build your app. Lets make
sure you get a solid understanding of them.

## Hot reload

One of the many cool things Create React App gives us is a development server that
supports hot reloading of your code. You will move faster with changes immediately
applied to the browser as you type them.

To see this live in action go to the src folder in the project and open
the ```App.tsx``` file, change some text and save the file.

Check your browser at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
The changes have been applied instantly!

Cool stuff. We are set to build an awesome app üí™üèº
