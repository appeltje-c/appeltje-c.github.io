# Intro

> written by [Martijn Benjamin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/martijn-benjamin/) ([appeltje-c](https://github.com/appeltje-c))

In these docs I am taking you through the steps of making a RESTful API from scratch touching the
relevant topics in the order of how they more or less appear when building an API service.

## How to read the docs

You can follow the arrows to step along or search and hop around through search- and sidebars as you see fit. Depending 
on your experience you can more or less freestyle back and forward.

Each topic consists of a "Read" and a "Code" section which comes in the order depending on your personality ðŸ¤“

## Assumed knowledge

Prior knowledge is expected in the form of the use of command line tools like git, basic javascript, html and css
understanding and common client/server concepts.

## Code

The result of these docs can be found in the (node) "starter-api" repo where it might serve you as a good starting
point for building a Rest API.

You can find the repos [here](https://github.com/appeltje-c?tab=repositories) together with any example repo's
created along the way.
