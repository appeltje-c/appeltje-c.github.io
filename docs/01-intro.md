# Hello 👋🏽

> written by [Martijn Benjamin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/martijn-benjamin/) ([appeltje-c](https://github.com/appeltje-c))

## Intro

These docs are an effort to bring useful software engineering topics covering browser app engineering and service technologies commonly needed to create feature rich apps.

We will be using a very practical approach to illustrate solutions to common use cases with the goal to learn and document for those interested.

Happy coding! 💙

## How to read the docs

In these docs I document the steps of making a React App and Rest API from scratch touching the relevant topics in the order of how they more or less appear when building apps.

You can follow the arrows to step along or search and hop around through search- and sidebars as you see fit.

Each topic can be explored on its own although there might be references to earlier topics.

Prior knowledge is expected in the form of command line use, basic javascript understanding and common client/server concepts.

Each topic will have a "Get the hands dirty" section for those who can do without context and lets you jump straight into writing code.

## Repos

The result of these docs can be found in the (react) "starter-app" and (node) "starter-api" repos where they might serve you as a good starting point for building a web app and rest api's.

You can find the repos [here](https://github.com/appeltje-c?tab=repositories) together with any example repo's created along the way.
