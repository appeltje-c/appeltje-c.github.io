Deciding to digg in and find ways to an understanding of 3D graphics on the web triggers the urge to completely peel the 
3D onion. What we see on a screen spinning, moving and looking so real is the end result of many steps taken. To 
understand 3D is to understand each of these steps.

To be able to utilize the tools at hand you need to know how they were built and operate themselves. Knowing how things 
work under-the-hood might save you when running into complexity, which mostly bites you in the ass when you least expect 
it.

In these docs it is about learning by doing from the onions' jacket to the core.
